# Project Overview
This project analyzes U.S. domestic flight data from the year 2007 to identify patterns and factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations. Using data visualization and statistical analysis in Hive as well as Python, we examine temporal trends, delay causes, and route-specific performance to gain actionable insights into airline operations.
# Key Objectives
-Understand the overall patterns of flight delays and cancellations.

-Identify the major contributing factors to delays (e.g., weather, carrier, NAS).

-Explore seasonal, weekly, and daily trends in delay frequency and severity.

-Analyze specific routes with the highest average delay durations.

-Assess the performance of different airlines in terms of cancellations and delays.
# Main Findings
-Arrival delays are generally shorter than departure delays, potentially due to in-flight adjustments.

-Delays are more frequent and severe during evening and night hours.

-September to November show the least average delays and cancellations.

-The top three delay causes are Late Aircraft, Carrier, and NAS issues.

-Flight cancellations are primarily caused by Weather, NAS, and Carrier-related factors.

-Certain carriers exhibit higher cancellation rates, while some premium airlines show near-zero cancellations.

-The most delayed routes each have different dominant causes of delay, highlighting operational complexity.
