Project Overview
This project analyzes U.S. domestic flight data from the year 2007 to identify patterns and factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations. Using data visualization and statistical analysis in Hive as well as Python, we examine temporal trends, delay causes, and route-specific performance to gain actionable insights into airline operations.
Key Objectives
Understand the overall patterns of flight delays and cancellations.

Identify the major contributing factors to delays (e.g., weather, carrier, NAS).

Explore seasonal, weekly, and daily trends in delay frequency and severity.

Analyze specific routes with the highest average delay durations.

Assess the performance of different airlines in terms of cancellations and delays.
